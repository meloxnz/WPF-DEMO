## Details

- **WPF line**: Demonstrates predicted and true wind power for 288 sequence lengths over the next two days
- **Wind Speed**: Shows real and simulated wind speeds
- **MAE and Group**: Statistical grouping of 288 sequences by error range
- **Reliability**: Demonstrate percentage of acceptable margin of error
- **Current & Forecasting**: Wind speed and wind power for current and prediction
- **Statistic**: Shows the average wind power error for the current 288 sequence, the average error for points in the acceptable range, and the average error for all data
- **Wind Curve**: Shows the location of real-time wind speed and power point across the wind turbine curve
